# Simulated Annealing in Chip Placement

## Overview

This repository contains a C++ project that utilizes simulated annealing in the placement step of creating an integrated chip. The project includes a graphical user interface (GUI) component implemented using the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) to visualize the placement process.

## Features

- Simulated annealing algorithm for chip placement.
- Graphical representation of the chip layout using SFML.
- Customizable parameters for the simulated annealing process.
- Visualization of the temperature decay and total wire length changes during optimization.

## Dependencies

- C++ compiler
- SFML library (version X.X.X)
  - [SFML Installation Guide](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-linux.php)
